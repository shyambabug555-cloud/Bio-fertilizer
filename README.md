# Soil Image Detector — Crop / Soil Condition Classifier

**Short description:**  
A lightweight image-based soil/crop condition detection tool that takes a soil or leaf image and returns a diagnosis (e.g., healthy, nutrient-deficient, fungal infection) along with a confidence score and suggested next steps.

## Features
- Classifies soil/crop condition from an image (e.g., Healthy, Nitrogen Deficiency, Potassium Deficiency, Fungal Disease, Water Stress).
- Returns a confidence score for the predicted class.
- Provides short actionable advice for common conditions.
- Simple CLI and script-based usage; easy to extend to a web or mobile UI.

## Tech stack
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow / Keras (or PyTorch — replace with your framework)
- OpenCV / Pillow for image preprocessing
- NumPy, Pandas (optional, for dataset/metrics)
- Flask (optional — for creating a web API)
